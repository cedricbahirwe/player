# player V 1.0
## This is a simple music player built in swift using AVFoundation and  SwiftUI

### Note that the song files are stored in the project (making the project heavier), this was for demonstration purpose and should not be included in future realeases ( Future versions may use a cloud based platform to upload/ get song files ) (like GDrive) which will it easier to either download or stream
